     The BULLET SWAGE MANUAL, T. Smith, 1976, 45 pgs.
          
          This book is one of the earliest works on bullet swaging,  written 
     by  a  pioneer in the field.   Many of the illustrations are  of  early 
     Corbin swaging tools.   The book is intended as a primer for beginners, 
     but belongs in any complete library of swaging as a historical work.

     The CORBIN TECHNICAL BULLETINS, Volume III   1983, 106 pgs.

          Experimental work with custom bullets, the rise of the survivalist 
     movements,  and concerns about the future supplies of bullets in the US 
     and  abroad  brought  a flood of technical  articles  addressing  these 
     subjects.   Original  papers  and translations from trade journals  are 
     included.  Bonding and heat treatment of jackets, manufacture of copper 
     tubing bullets, and hunting bullets are covered in detail.

     POWER SWAGING, D. Corbin   1984, 195 pgs.

          Also known as Corbin Technical Bulletins,  Volume IV,  this is the 
     bible of commercial bullet making. It is filled with data on pressures, 
     forces,  and die strength, calculations, charts, computer programs, and 
     photos.   Hundreds  of dollars worth of dies were destroyed to test the 
     limits of the formulae, and photos of these are included as well.  
          The  book  serves  as an operator's  guide  for  the  Hydro-press, 
     although  it  also covers several earlier models of air  and  hydraulic 
     power  presses  that  are no longer manufactured.   Two  very  valuable 
     chapters deal with organization of a custom bullet business,  and  with 
     the  numbers  involved in  production  volume.   Marketing,  promotion, 
     feasibility  studies,  and  selection of a product line are written  so 
     they can be understood by a beginner, yet interesting enough to attract 
     experienced engineers.

     at  gunsmithing schools.   You'll find detailed,  accurate  information 
     arranged in twenty-two chapters,  covering everything from lubricant to 
     lead,  pressure to press design, history of swaging (including original 
     letters  from  Biehler and Astles,  Fred  Huntington,  and  Capt.  G.L. 
     Wotkyns  at  critical points during the 1940 to 1960 period)  and  just 
     about anything else you might care to know about swaging.   If you only 
     want one book, make it this one.

     The WORLD DIRECTORY of CUSTOM BULLET MAKERS  

          Data  has  been collected from all over the world for a decade  on 
     bullet  markets,  and  the people who are active in the  custom  bullet 
     field.   If you are looking for a certain caliber -- modern,  obsolete, 
     wildcat,  foreign, or experimental -- this is the sourcebook for people 
     who  can make it!   Articles of interest to  experimenters,  purchasing 
     agents, engineers, and ballisticians as well as those who might wish to 
     enter the custom bullet field as suppliers are included.
          Editors,  writers,  and publishers of firearms journals around the 
     world have a copy of this book for reference.  Buyers in government and 
     industry, defense agencies and law enforcement operations, game control 
     commissions,  ballistic labs, and applied science libraries can turn to 
     the sources listed to find out who makes what.  
          Corbin  customers who are selling bullets commercially are invited 
     to  write for a free listing in the book's next  edition.   Advertising 
     space is periodically available  to qualified firms.   Agencies dealing 
     with firearms-related suppliers should check out the tremendous  market 
     exposure this book gives.

     The CORBIN HANDBOOK and CATALOG of BULLET SWAGING, No. 7

          You are reading a copy now!   If you would like additional  copies 
     for friends,  order directly from Corbin.  This is the seventh edition: 
     it  is  not the seventh book of the collection,  or the  seventh  year, 
     since Corbin has been in business much longer than that.   We publish a 
     new  edition  whenever the information becomes outmoded  and  continued 
     editions of the same book begin to lose their relevance to newer ideas.

     The Corbin IMMEDIATE DELIVERY LIST
     
          This  is a list of dies available for immediate  delivery.   Since 
     Corbin dies are all hand-made products, individually diamond lapped and 
     fitted,  there  can be a considerable backlog on certain calibers  from 
     time  to time.   The Immediate Delivery List tells what is on the shelf 
     right now.   It changes from month to month, and is not a guarentee but 
     only  a  temporary  listing.   If you  see  something  you  want,  call 
     immediately  and  use your VISA/MASTER-CHARGE card to have  it  shipped 
     right  away.   (Sorry - no holding for future payment!   Demand is just 
     too high to tie up products in this manner.)
          This  list  is  free  for the  asking,  when  ordered  with  other 
     literature  or  products.   Included with most shipments  is  also  our 
     current  price list,  any specials we may have on supplies or products, 
     announcements of new books or computer software, etc.

     CORBIN COMPUTER SOFTWARE

          Now you can design bullets quickly,  easily, with Corbin's DC-1001 
     Bullet Design program.  All you need to know is the weight and style of 
     bullet you want to make -- the program asks these simple questions, and 
     then  calculates  the  ballistic  coefficient,   form  factor,  average 
     density, stable twist rate, core and jacket volumes, core weight, over-
     all length,  length of ogive and length of shank, and a number of other 
     parameters of importance to makers of commercial bullets.  
          If you don't know what to answer,  the program supplies a standard 
     default  value.   You  can  just  hit the  "enter"  key,  and  run  the 
     calculation  automatically with all default values if you wish,  to see 
     how it works.  You need absolutely NO math background, NO experience in 
     bullet design or ballistics.  Automatic tables appear on the screen for 
     each  question that requires some special knowledge,  and  the  program 
     checks  your input to see if it is reasonable.   If not,  it gives  you 
     another chance to input a value, or just hit return and let the program 
     supply a value.
          There is no way you can "mess up" this program.   And best of all, 
     when  you  have designed the bullet (which takes perhaps two  seconds), 
     those values can be printed out,  and/or automatically used in a second 
     program that is part of the first one:   kinetic parameters.   You  can 
     "fire"  the  bullet  at any velocity within reason,  see what  kind  of 
     energy density,  muzzle energy,  momentum,  and other values the bullet 
     would  have.   And,  you can change one or more parameters and  try  it 
     again to see the effect, all within seconds.  The program keeps all the 
     values  you put in last,  and uses them until you change them.   If you 
     turn  off  the program,  it resets to standard default  values  so  you 
     can't "get lost" or forget important standard values.
          The  DC-1001 program is currently available on 5-1/4" floppy  disk 
     for  IBM-PC/XT  or  /AT computers.  The  program  is  completely  self-
     contained  in executable machine code for the 8088 processor,  and runs 
     at either 4.77 mhz or at accelerated clock rates.   Either color or B&W 
     monitors will work.   All display is in the text mode.  The disk is NOT 
     copy  protected and can be loaded onto your hard disk drive.              
          Don't confuse DC-1001 with ordinary external ballistics  programs:  
     it  is  not  merely  an electronic table  of  values,  but  a  powerful 
     calculus-based  tool  for design of bullets.   It is not the same as  a 
     program  that  gives  you drop and remaining  energy  for  an  existing 
     bullet,  but  a way to create new bullets of your own design.   You can 
     input various densities of core and jacket material,  and find out what 
     effect aluminum,  tungsten,  brass, or plastic might have on the bullet 
     paramters.   You  can even select the target material density and  find 
     out what spin rate would stabilize the bullet in space,  in air,  under 
     water,  or in any other media.   DC-1001 is a one-of-a-kind program for 
     the bullet maker. (To run the program, simply type "Bullets").
