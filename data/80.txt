THE 10 COMMANDMENTS OF STREET FIGHTING
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Never underestimate your attacker. Assume that he is dangerous.
2. Don't get fancy. Use simple but effective tactics.
3. Always be sure to maintain your balance.
4. Be quick and keep the reactions flowing. Keep striking, never let up until
you know your aggressor is down for good.
5. Nothing is unfair. THERE ARE NO RULES!
6. While counter-attacking, NEVER lose sight of your opponent.
7. Deliver ALL blows to weaker areas.
8. Keep yelling and cursing as you counter.
9. Use any available object or weapon to detract your assailant's techniques.
10. Fight as if YOUR life depends upon the success of YOUR counter-attacks. It
just might!
