   War Cycles / Peace Cycles
     by Richard Kelly Hoskins

   Richard Kelly Hoskins has spent more than a quarter of a century
   working with Wall Street.  His articles have been published in
   newspapers and magazines across the nation.  This book may very well
   be the survival handbook of this generation.  Cyclical
   interpretations of the boom/bust phenomenon that has dogged
   organized economies since antiquity are in vogue once again.  This
   one, by stock broker and financial consultant Hoskins, examines the
   process in the light of time-dishonored man ipulation by
   international usurers, from Babylon to today's Wall Street.

A few reports from Readers:
   "...a new book...by Richard Hoskins...It is very, very good...he
 reveals that in 1780 there were only two interest banks in the new
 United States.  Most of our colonial forefathers lived their whole
 lives in peace and prosperity without ever doing business with a bank!
 Today most Americans would think that was impossible."  -Sheldon Emry,

   "We were VERY impressed with your book...Grandmother said that it
answered the one question she had in college...WHY?  She didn't believe
that Jenkins War was over a man's ear or that an assassination in
Austria could cause the whole world to explode into WW I."  -
