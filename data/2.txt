                              100 Ways to Avoid Dying
                                   By: Tim Clark
                          MS-Dos Version By: Peter Schwab
                        Article from: 1990 Farmer's Almanac

       Doctors and scientists  are  always  telling us ways to live longer.
       Usually they involve a healthier diet  or lifestyle: that is, eating
       less fat and more vegetables and fruits, getting more  exercise,  or
       giving up smoking.

       We wholeheartedly endorse  these  rigorous and unpleasant methods of
       extending life, but our research  into  centuries  of  American folk
       wisdom has turned up 100 EASY ways of avoiding death  by observing a
       few simple rules in everyday situations. These beliefs come from all
       over this country   and  were  actually  collected  by  students  of
       folklore and anthropology.

       None of them were made up. Just remember:  if  you  fail  to observe
       these rules, we won't be responsible for the consequences!

       HOUSEKEEPING HINTS

        1. Don't take ashes out of the fireplace or wood stove between
           Christmas and New Year's Day.
        2. Never place a broom on a bed.
        3. Close umbrellas before bringing them into a house.
        4. Avoid sweeping after sundown.
        5. You mustn't wash clothes on New Year Day.
        6. Don't shake out a tablecloth after dark.
        7. Never wash a flag.
        8. Don't turn a chair on one leg.
        9. Keep cats off piano keys.
       10. Don't hang a dishcloth on a doorknob.
       11. Sweeping under a sick person's bed will kill him or her.
       12. Don't ever, ever rock an empty rocking chair.

       RENOVATION AND DECORATING

       13. Never add-on to the back of your house.
       14. You mustn't cut a new window in an old house; the only way to
           avoid fatal consequences is to toss your apron through the
           new window, and then jump through it yourself.
       15. Never drive a nail after sunset.

       17. Avoid carring axes, shovels, and other sharp-edged tools

       30. Never wear another's new clothes before they have worn them.
       31. A woman who makes her own wedding dress will not live to wear
           it.

       43. Don't sing in bed.
       44. If you hear a dog howl at night, reach under the bed and turn
           over a shoe.
       45. Don't count stars.
       46. A man should never dream of a naked woman; a woman should
           never dream of a naked man. (You know who you are...)

       48. Don't look into a mirror over another's shoulder.
