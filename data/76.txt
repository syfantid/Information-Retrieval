Medical researchers in the U.S. and Britain are trying to figure out how
and why a unique type of South American folk remedy against snakebite
works.

The treatment involves the application of low amperage-high voltage
electric shock to the site of a snakebite.  this type of shock is very
similar to that produced by a stun gun.  In South American jungles the
shock is often produced by an automobile or motorcycle spark plug wire.

In 34 documented cases people bitten by poisonous snakes were given a
series of four to five electric shocks on the wound.  All of the patients
recovered within an hour of the treatment and were able to function
normally.  All of the pain from the bites was gone in 15 minutes.  In
follow up interviews, none of the patients showed tissue damage from the
snake bites, or the shock treatment.
