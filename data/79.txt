Self defence becomes more important every year. Yet the traditional Martial
Arts demand a physical fitness and understanding of complex techniques which
are beyond most of us.

HERE IS A NEW AND PRACTICAL SYSTEM WHICH RECOGNISES OUR LIMITATIONS.

It is quick and easy to learn because it is based on adopting one move to a
variety of defensive situations.

The system assumes that the defence will be against a more powerful attacker.

INTRODUCTION :
--------------

This file has been written for those of us who do not want to take up the
martial arts as a sport, but who would like to be able to defend ourselves in
a potentially dangerous situation.

This course is intended to teach you to cope with practical situations, i.e.
circumstances in which you may actually find yourself. You may not aspire to
a black belt, but you will learn how to defend yourself effectively in a
emergency. You don't have to be particularly fit or well co-ordinated to use
these techniques, which have also been designated for the not-so-strong.
They are simple and easy to learn. They are also highly effective.

PRACTICE :
----------

"Practice makes perfect" they say, and this is true. Practise what you would
do in a serious situation, so that you are sure of your moves. Try to do 
this with a partner, to help you practise the timing of these moves. Try to
choose moves which you find easier and which come more naturally to you.
It is advisable to practise in your everyday clothes, as these are what you
are most likely to be wearing in the event of an attack.

Practise punching, kicking and jabbing as described in the PART II firstly and
very slowly. When you have mastered the moves slowly, build up your speed and
power, but without a partner. Finally, practise your self defence techniques
with a partner, so that you can put what you have learned into practice and 
get used to body contact.

SOME GENERAL GROUND RULES :
---------------------------

There are some important rules on how to react if attacked. If you bear 
these in mind, you already have the advantage over your attacker.

If at all possible, avoid a confrontation. Try to engage your assailant in
a conversation. This way you gain time to calm yourself down and work out
an effective strategy to fight off your attacker.
If you cannot avoid a fight :

1. Breathe slowly and deeply to calm your nerves.
2. ALWAYS look your attacker in the eyes.
3. Turn sideways to make it harder for your attacker to grab you.
4. Only use techniques you have really mastered. DON'T hesitate.
5. Be careful not to let yourself be cornered, and don't allow yourself to be
   backed up into a doorway or against a wall.

THE LAW AND SELF DEFENCE :
--------------------------

Section 3(1) of the Criminal Law Act 1967 states : 

 " .... a person may use reasonable force in the prevention of crime ...."

Obviously " prevention of crime " covers a wide range, but this may include

1. Defence of yourself
2. Defence of another
3. Defence of property

What is considered reasonable depends on the circumstances and is, ultimately,
a matter for a jury to decide. That is, if you have been slapped, it would be
unreasonable to defend yourself with a knife. If you use more force than is
reasonable in the circumstances, you could be prosecuted.

SHOCK TACTICS. THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE :
----------------------------------------

Surprise is an important factor in self defence. If used properly it throws
your assailant off balance and may give you valuable time. There are many
types of shock tactics but I shall restrict myself to a few simple ones which
will distract or confuse your attacker.

1. Sudden, loud screaming
2. Spitting in the attacker's face
3. Smiling while looking behind of the attacker

THE MOST VULNERABLE AREAS OF THE HUMAN BODY :
---------------------------------------------

The eyes and groin are your MAIN TARGETS. A hard kick or punch in the groin
will quickly put men out of action, and can even render them unconscious.
This is a very sensitive part of the body and very vulnerable to injury, no
matter how big and strong a man can be. You can achieve similar results by
jabbing your assailant in the eyes with your fingers, which is one of the
best methods of self defence. Your attacker will be helpless if he cannot see.

Of course, the human body can be attacked in other areas like nose, chin, 
knee, shin and bridge of the foot. These are your SECONDARY TARGETS.

DIRECT YOUR PUNCHES AND KICKS, AS DESCRIBED, ONLY AT THE MARKED POINTS OF THE
BODY, AS OTHERWISE THEY MAY NOT AFFECT YOUR ATTACKER.

THE RIGHT STANCE :
------------------

Correct stance is essential as a basis for all defence movements. In order to
achieve maximum mobility, balance your weight equally on both legs, keeping
your knees slightly bent. Do not tense up; relax and be prepared to react
quickly on all sides. Your shoulders should be diagonal to your assailant, so
that you present the least surface area for your attacker to grab. Protect
your chest and your chin by keeping your arms up at an angle. Clench your 
fists to minimise any damage to your fingers when defending or blocking. This
is NOT a static position, quite the opposite, and you should be constantly
moving, like a boxer in the ring. Do not keep your arms still, but remember to
keep up your guard. This behaviour will confuse your attacker, leaving him no
time to recognise the defensive action you may be taking. Try to stay out of
reach of your attacker, but remember to maintain eye contact.

USING YOUR HANDS :
------------------

In this part of the course you will learn techniques in which you can use your
hands, arms, elbows or fingers as weapons with which to disable your attacker.
The difference between a punch and a slap is the way in which the arm or hand
movement is carried out. When pushing or punching, the arm movement is always
straight ahead, towards the attacker, whereas, when slapping, the arm movement
is circular or semi-circular (a swing or a hook).

In self defence it's very important to learn how to use your hands as weapons.
A well-targeted punch, using the heel of your hand or elbow, is easily carried
out and highly effective if your FULL body weight is behind it.

It is NOT necessary to harden the skin on your hands or elbows on order to 
make'em less sensitive to pain; they have been designated by nature to resist
knocks and punches.

Making a fist in the correct way is very important to prevent any finger
injuries when punching your assailant or using blocking techniques. When your
fist is clenched correctly, the thumb should lie in front of your index and
middle finger, and NOT be covered by them.

Move 1 : JABBING WITH THE HEEL OF THE HAND

Bend the fingers up, hold your palm upright and bend it back as far back as 
you can. Take up the correct stance and push your hand forward with as much
force as possible. The palm will connect with the target area. Remember to
swivel your hips and follow through in the same direction. The best effects
can be achieved if you hit your attacker just under the nose

Move 1 : DEMONSTRATION

1. Your opponent is about to aim a punch at your head.
2. Take evasive action by moving one step diagonally forward from the normal
   position.
3. Block the punch and, at the same time, jab the heel of your hand under your
   attacker's nose.

Move 2 : THE FINGER JAB

This techniques is highly effective but may also cause severe eye injury. For
this reason, the finger jab should only be used in life-threatening attacks.
Bend your index and middle fingers slightly. Stand in the correct basic stance
and move forwards to carry out the finger jab.

Move 2 : DEMONSTRATION

1. Your assailant is trying to strangle you with both hands.
2. Hunch your shoulders and pull your chin in to protect your neck.
3. Now jab your assailant in the eyes with your fingers, taking a step 
   backwards at the same time.

Move 3 : ELBOW PUNCH

The most important thing to remember here is to bend your arm very sharply.
You can elbow forwards or backwards. Your assailant is then hit by the hard 
little bone of elbow. If you elbow forwards, your arm moves in a semi-circle,
hitting the side of your attacker's face or his chin. If you elbow backwards,
stretch your arm out forwards, with the back of your clenched fist facing
downwards, and then bring your arm backwards sharply and with as much force as
you can muster. In both cases, your fists should stay clenched and you should
follow through with your shoulders.

Move 3 : DEMONSTRATION

1. Your attacker grabs your arm.
2. You step forward, bringing your arm up in a semi-circle.
3. As you set your foot down, elbow your attacker in the face. This way you
   have the FULL force of your body weight behind you.

USING YOUR FEET :
-----------------

Using your legs gives you the advantage of greater reach, coupled with the 
fact that your legs are considerably stronger than your arms. If you react
quickly enough, there is a good chance that you will be able to stop the
attack in its initial stages. All the kicks are easy to learn. Good balance 
and speed are important. A quick, powerful kick to a sensitive part of the
body is one of the best methods of self defence. Aim your kicks below the belt
and always kick with as much speed and force as possible.

Move 1 : FRONT KICK

Start with your kicking foot behind you. Then raise your knee until your thigh
is almost horizontal and kick sharply upwards with the lower half of your leg.
Then bring your leg back quickly to the starting position, with your kicking
foot behind you. This kick is carried out in one movement, with the bridge of
your foot hitting your attacker's groin. Imagine you are kicking a foot ball
with all your might.

Move 1 : DEMONSTRATION

1. The attacker grabs you with both arms.
2. You set your kicking foot behind you and spread your arms out.
3. Now lift your leg and shoot your lower leg forwards
 
Move 2 : SIDE KICK

When you use the side kick, you hit either your attacker's knee or shin with
the outside edge of your foot, or the sole of your foot. Lift your front foot
up to knee height and then, using your hip, kick sideways with as much force 
as you can, keeping your leg extended. By pivoting on your balancing foot, you
will be able to use full force of your hips and follow the movement through.
If carried out correctly, the heel fo your extended foot will point towards
your assailant. Bring your leg back to the starting position immediately. To
add power to your technique, lean a plank of wood against a wall and practise
the hip movement, by kicking the plank until you can break it. Remember to 
keep your shoes on when practising this techniques (if you are VERY stupid you
can try that with your shoes OFF !!!!!)

Move 2 : DEMONSTRATION

1. Your attacker grabs your arm.
2. Lift your front knee up.
3. Keeping your leg extended sideways, kick your attacker in the knee.
4. Then wrench your arm free.

Move 3 : HEEL STAMP

The heel stamp is used solely to distract your opponent, before you follow it
up with another defence technique or action. From your basic position, bring
your knee up as high as possible and then stamp down sharply with the heel of
your foot. Your heel should hit the bridge of your assailant's foot. Remember
to keep your toes pointing upwards, so that your heel is in the correct 
position. If you are carrying out a heel stamp to the rear, keep your toes
pointing downwards, to make sure you connect with your target. You should hit,
rather than his thumb, the weakest point, i.e. the little finger.

Move 3 : DEMONSTRATION

1. Your assailant grabs your arm.
2. Lift your foot and stamp on your assailant's foot with all your might.
3. Then wrench your arm free.

Move 4 : KNEEING YOUR OPPONENT

This is a technique used in close combat and therefore ideally suited to self
defence. Speed and power are essential for this move to be effective. The top
of your knee should connect with your assailant's groin.

Move 4 : DEMONSTRATION

1. Your assailant grabs you in a body hold with both arms.
2. Grab your assailant by the hips, push yourself away from him, at the same
   time stepping back with one leg.
3. Pull your opponent down and bring your knee up sharply into his groin, with
   as much force as you can.

BLOCKING OR DEFENSIVE TACTICS :
-------------------------------

As you would expect, it is defence and not attack, which is the cornerstone of
self defence. The object is to divert or deflect any blows or punches your
assailant may be aiming to you, and to protect your own body from severe 
injury. It is only possible to attack your opponent if you first deflect his
attack on you. First, we should distinguish between the upward block, which
deflects attacks to the head and shoulders, and the downward block, which
prevents attacks on the chest and abdomen. When defending yourself, never
carry out only a blocking movement, without following it up with a counter
move. Only by doing both, will you be able to prevent any renewed attack, and
also protect yourself.

Move 1 : UPWARD BLOCK              FIGURE.1

				   =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Move your rear leg diagonally forward from the basic stance, bringing your arm
up in front of your face. The power of any attack on you can be further 
diluited by stepping to the side or rear with other leg.

Move 1 : DEMONSTRATION 

1. You are in the basic defence stance.
2. Your attacker tries to throw a punch to your head. You move diagonally
   forwards, deflecting the power of the blow.
3. The underside of your forearm immediately blocks your attacker's striking
   arm.

Move 2 : DOWNWARD BLOCK

Here, again, you should move diagonally forward from the basic position and
bring your arm down to protect the lower part of the body.

Move 2 : DEMONSTRATION

1. Your assailant attemps to punch you in the abdomen. 
2. From the basic stance, move diagonally forward, slamming your arm down
   sharply on your opponent's wrist.
3. Now deflect your assailant's striking arm to the side, weakening the 
   potential force of the blow.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Wrenching free from a body hold is not always easy. This is why it is crucial
to react as quickly as possible if an assailant tries to grab and hold you, so
that the attack can be stopped in its initial stages. However, if your 
attacker has already managed to get you in a body hold, the next few pages
should help you to deal with this. By using the following techniques, with as
much power as you can, you will probably be able to break free.

FINGER WRENCH :
---------------

This can be extremely painful if properly carried out. The pain can be
maximised by pulling and twisting the finger joints. Pull the fingers away 
from the joints: in this case it is up and back across the back of the hand.
Pull the little finger if possible, because this is the weakest joint.

COMPRESSION BLOW:
-----------------

Cup your hands over your assailant's ears, and then slam your hands very 
sharply into the side of the head, so that the compressed air in your hands
creates pressure in the ears of your adversary. This creates a balance
distrubance and temporarily disables your attacker.

HEAD BUTT:
----------

Use your forehead, or the back of your head, to butt your opponent. This move
has the advantage of the element of surprise and will not injure you,
providing you hit your attacker's nose. You will be considerably more sure to
hit nose if you can grip your attacker's head.

OTHER VARIOUS TECHNIQUES:
-------------------------

* GETTING OUT OF A ONE-ARM HOLD
  You are leaning against a fence. A man tries to force his attentions on you,
  placing an arm around your shoulders. Elbow him sharply in the ribs and
  follow up with a powerful punch to the nose.

* DEALING WITH AN AMBUSH
  You are walking along the street. Suddenly someone grabs you and tries to
  force his attentions on you. Raise your knee and, using the front kick
  technique, kick your assailant in the groin.

* DEALING WITH A SHOULDER HOLD FROM BEHIND
  A man is following you. He grabs you by the shoulder and tries to pull you
  towards him. Spin round as fast as you can and jab his nose with the heel of
  your hand.

* DEFENDING YOURSELF WHILST SEATED 
  You are sitting on a bench. A man sits down next to you and puts his hand
  on your knee. Stay seated, swivel round and jab him in the nose with the 
  heel of your hand.

* WHEN YOUR BAG IS GRABBED FROM BEHIND
  You are standing in the street. Suddenly someone grabs your bag from behind.
  Bend your arm inwards to hold on tight to your bag and follow up with a side
  kick to the knee.

* IF YOUR HAIR IS PULLED FROM THE SIDE
  An assailant approaches from behind and then pulls your hair from the side.
  Grab your opponent's arm and turn inwards to face him. Then jab your
  attacker on the nose with the heel of your hand.

* IF YOUR HAIR IS PULLED FROM THE FRONT
  Your assailant pulls your hair from the front. Grab him by the hips, pull
  him down and slam your knee into his groin.

* DEALING WITH A DIAGONAL HAND HOLD
  Your assailant grabs you by the forearm. Step towards your assailant. Jab 
  him in the nose with the heel of your hand and wrench your arm away.

* IF YOU ARE ATTACKED GETTING OUT OF YOUR CAR
  Your attacker opens your car door and tries to pull you out of the car. Lean
  back across the passenger seat and slam your foot heel into opponent's face
  or groin. If you do NOT have time to carry out the above move, you may still
  be able to defend yourself with a finger jab to the eyes.

* UNDERARM HOLD FROM BEHIND
  You are about to open your car door. At that moment you are grabbed from the
  rear. You raise your knee and stamp hard on your opponent's foot. Then grab
  your assailant's little finger and pull it right back. Your assailant will
  loosen his grip and you will be able to break free. Then jab his nose with
  the heel of your hand.
 
* OVERARM HOLD FROM BEHIND
  Your attacker grabs you from behind with both arms. Raise your knee and 
  stamp hard on your assailant's foot. Now pull your arm forward and snap it
  back sharply into your assailant's ribs. Turn to face your attacker and jab
  him in the nose with the heel of your hand.

* GETTING OUT OF A DOUBLE NELSON
  Your opponent has got you in a double Nelson. You react with the utmost
  speed and raise your knee. Stamp with all your weight, keeping your heel
  well down. Then move your arms up and pull your attacker's little finger
  wrenching it to the side. Once you have broken free, slam your elbow back
  into your attacker.

* UNDERARM HOLD FROM THE FRONT
  You are walking along a path. Suddenly you are grabbed from the front by
  someone walking towards you. Hit your attacker on both ears using a
  compression blow and break free, jabbing your assailant's nose with the
  heel of your hand.

* OVERARM BODY HOLD FROM THE FRONT
  Your opponent grabs you with both arms. Raise your knee and stamp hard on 
  your attacker's foot so that he will loosen his grip. Then knee your
  assailant in the groin.

* GETTING OUT OF A HEAD HOLD
  Your attacker has your head in a firm hold. Hit your attacker in the groin
  with the heel of your hand. At the same time, use your other hand to pull
  your attacker's hair and pull hime backwards away from you. Then jab your
  attacker on the chin with the heel of your hand.

* STRANGLE HOLD FROM BEHIND
  Your assailant approaches from behind and begins to strangle you. Tense your
  neck muscles and stretch your arms out in front and then elbow your
  assailant in the ribs, as hard as you can. At the same time, use the other
  hand to free yourself from the strangle hold. Then turn around and jab your
  attacker with the heel of your hand.

* STRANGLE HOLD FROM THE FRONT
  You are just about to get into your car. You are attacked and your assailant
  tries to strangle you with both hands. From the basic position, jab your
  assailant in the nose with the heel of your hand, following through with 
  your hips to help you hit with more strenght. If this does NOT work, use a
  finger jab to help you break free.

* FOREARM STRANGLE HOLD FROM BEHIND
  You are sitting down when you are grabbed from behind. Tense your neck 
  muscles immediately and pull your attacker's hair forwards. If your
  attacker's grip becomes too tight, use a finger jab.

* IF YOU ARE ATTACKED IN THE CAR
  The attacker tries to strangle you through the car window. Tense your neck
  muscles and finger jab your attacker in the eyes.

* IF YOU ARE THROWN TO THE GROUND #1
  Your attacker tries to strangle you after having thrown you to the ground.
  Jab him in the eyes with your fingers then pull your assailant's hair with
  one hand and take hold of his chin with the other. Pull your attacker's head
  downwards, twisting it at the same time, using your other hand (neck twist).
  Pull your leg up and roll over sideways, freeing yourself from your 
  attacker.

* IF YOU ARE THROWN TO THE GROUND #2
  Your assailant has brought you down and is approaching you again. He is 
  about to kick you. Raise your knee and then kick your opponent on the shin,
  using the side kick technique.

  NOTE: If attacked when lying down, make sure your legs and feet are facing
        your assailant, as this gives him the least possible opportunity to
        grab you.
 
* FIST PUNCH FROM BEHIND
  You are leaning over the boot of the car. Your assailant grabs hold of your
  right shoulder and tries to throw a right-hand punch to your head. Turn 
  round to face your attacker and block the punch with your left arm, then jab
  your assailant's nose with the heel of your hand.

* FIST PUNCH FROM THE FRONT
  You are about to open the door of a telephone box. Without warning someone
  tries to punch you. You block the punch and jab your assailant's nose with
  the heel of your hand.

* IF PUNCHED WHEN SITTING
  Your attacker approaches you while you are sitting down and tries to punch
  you. Turn sideways away from your attacker then jab your attacker in the
  groin with the heel of your hand. Your fingers should be pointing towards
  the ground.

* IF GRABBED BY THE LAPEL
  Your attacker grabs hold of your lapel with his left hand and tries to punch
  you with his right. You take evasive action to the right, blocking the punch
  at the same time. Slam your left knee into your attacker's groin and then
  jab your attacker's ear with the heel of your hand.

How to defend yourself if you are threatened with a weapon is one of the most
difficult chapters in this course. If you have not FULLY mastered the 
techniques, your situation is a hazardous one. The best advice is to try to
avoid this type of confrontation in the first place. If this is not possible,
be as determinated as you can and do NOT show any hesitation.

IF THREATENED WITH A GUN:
-------------------------

Try to lull your attacker into a sense of security. Show that you are
frightened and distract your assailant by trying to engage him in a 
conversation. Any offensive action you may take has to start with a diversion.
One old, but surprisingly effective, ruse is to look over your assailant's
shoulder, for example, and act as if you have seen something important or
surprising. Do NOT make a move until your assailant has fallen in the trick.
The element of surprise is very important, so you must act with the utmost
speed.

DEMONSTRATION

Your assailant is holding a gun to your chest. After you have distracted your
attacker, take evasive action sideways, grab the assailant's gun hand and push
it away from you. Then, if the gun should go off, the bullet will not hit you.
Keep hold of the attacker's hand until he has let go of the gun. After taking
evasive action - always keep the assailant's gun hand blocked - jab your 
attacker in the eyes with your fingers. Hold the assailant's gun hand with one
hand and grab hold of the gun from the outside with the other. Now wrench the
gun free and pull it away backwards. You must always disarm your opponent in
order to prevent a further attack.

IF THREATENED WITH A STICK:
---------------------------

If you are threatened with a stick, make sure you dodge out of your attacker's
way, then come in as close as possible, leaving him no room to raise the stick
or put any power into a blow.

DEMONSTRATION

Your opponent is facing you, armed with a stick: he tries to hit you. From the
basic stance, take one step sideways and reach up to block the blow, thus
deflecting its force. After this evasive action, jab your assailant in the 
eyes with your fingers. Now grab the stick and pull it downwards out of your
assailant's hand.

IF THREATENED WITH A KNIFE:
---------------------------

This is a very dangerous situation. Again, try to distract or disable your
attacker, by throwing keys or spitting in his face for example.

DEMONSTRATION

Stand in the basic position. Your opponent tries to stab you. You block his
arm and take a step diagonally forward at the same time, then lean forward
and jab your opponent in the eyes with your fingers. Keep hold of your
assailant's arm until you have removed the weapon.

= PART V : EVERYDAY ARTICLES AS WEAPONS =
=			  	        =
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

This chapter shows how everyday articles can become weapons. Umbrellas, keys,
books, newspapers and other objects, which you may be carrying, can be used in
self defence. Any sprays, such as deodorant, hairsprays or perfume can also be
extremely useful, as you can spray this into your attacker's eyes.

USING A KEY:
------------

Your assailant grabs hold of your collar with both hands. With a key in your 
hand stab your assailant in the side of the face. Follow this up by jabbing 
your assailant's nose with the heel of your hand to free yourself completely.

USING A ROLLED-UP NEWSPAPER:
----------------------------

Your attacker grabs your arm from behind. Turn and face your attacker and jab
him under the nose with the rolled-up newspaper.

USING A BOOK AGAINST ATTACK FROM THE FRONT:
-------------------------------------------

Your attacker grabs you fron the front and prepares to punch you. You step
forward and block the punch with your forearm and jab the book under your
assailant's nose.

USING A BOOK AGAINST ATTACK FROM THE SIDE:
------------------------------------------

Your attacker approaches from the side and grabs your shoulder. You turn away
sideways and jab the book under your assailant's nose with both hands.

USING AN UMBRELLA:
------------------

You are strolling along the street. Your attacker grabs you from behind and
tries to force his attentions upon you. You immediately swivel your hips away
and slam your umbrella into your assailant's groin.

USING A HANDBAG:
----------------

You are walking along the park. Your assailant pesters you and tries to stop 
you. Without hesitating, you take your handbag from the shoulder and hit your
attacker in the face with it, distracting him for a moment. The you can use a
front kick to kick your assailant in the groin.
