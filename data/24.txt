                          KITS for your RELOADING PRESS 

     The  easiest  way to get started is to purchase a  complete  kit,  with 
     everything  you  need  to  start making your  own  private  "brand"  of 
     bullets!   Here  are  several kits that you can put together  yourself.  
     Just  specify the caliber,  and order however many bullet  jackets  and 
     other  supplies  you may want.   I've made suggestions  for  reasonable 
     amounts of supplies with each kit...
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------

                                ECONOMY .224 KIT 

          Order these items to make up your own minimal cost kit, for making 
     excellent quality .224 caliber bullets (.221,  .222,  5.56mm,  and .220 
     Swift  as  well as every other centerfire .22 made today uses  a  .224" 
     bullet).  The equipment listed can produce jacketed bullets using fired 
     .22  long rifle or short cases in the weight range of 45 to 60  grains, 
     with  a 6-caliber spitzer ogive and a flat base.  (No boattails,  other 
     ogives, or special work in the reloading press series -- rather defeats 
     the whole reason for it,  since these extras would bring the cost  more 
     in  line with the Mity Mite system,  and then you would be far ahead to 
     get a Mity Mite!)

          BSD-224R  Core Seater and Point Former, 2-die set
          RFJM-22R  Rimfire Jacket Maker, 224 caliber
          CSL-2     Corbin Swage Lube, 2-ounce bottle
          CM-4      Corbin 4-cavity adjustable core mould (specify 224)  

          If  you  prefer  the speed of cutting lead wire  to  the  slightly   
     lower cost of cast cores, you might prefer this package instead:

          BSD-224R  Core Seater and Point Former, 2-die set
          RFJM-22R  Rimfire Jacket Maker, 224 caliber
          CSL-2     Corbin Swage Lube, 2-ounce bottle
          PCS-1     Corbin Precision Core Cutter                           
          LW-25     Lead Wire, 25-lb. spool (specify 224)
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 

                                 DELUXE .224 KIT

          A faster, easier system includes the power ejector unit and a hand 
     cannelure  tool,  plus  a supply of commercial drawn jackets  for  high 
     precision  benchrest work.   I personally like this because it gives  a 
     good  chance to compare your own free jackets with the best  commercial 
     ones made today.

          BSD-224R  Core Seater and Point Former, 2-die set
          RFJM-22R  Rimfire Jacket Maker, 224 caliber
          CSL-2     Corbin Swage Lube, 2-ounce bottle
          CM-4      Corbin 4-cavity adjustable core mould (specify 22 cal)
          LW-25     Lead wire, 25 lb.  (specify .185" -- 22 caliber)
          PCS-1     Corbin Precision Core Cutter
          J-22-705  Jackets, 224 caliber, .705-length, box of 500
          HCT-1     Corbin Hand Cannelure Tool
          PE-1      Corbin Power Ejector Unit
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------

                                ECONOMY .243 KIT

          If  you  want to make 6mm bullets (.243 -.244 caliber) from  fired 
     .22 cases, then this is the right kit for you:

          BSD-243R  Core Seater and Point Former, 2-die set
          RFJM-6MR  Rimfire Jacket Maker, 6mm from 22LR
          CSL-2     Corbin Swage Lube, 2-ounce bottle
          CM-4      Corbin 4-cavity adjustable core mould (specify 6mm)
                    * Note: the 6mm and .224 both use the same .185 core --
                      You can use the same core mould for both.
          
          Or,  you might consider replacing the CM-4 mould with a lead  wire 
     cutter and a spool of lead wire, for safer, faster bullet-making.

          If  you wish to use commercial jackets,  leave out the RFJM-6M and 
     instead, order the following jackets:

          J-6M-750  Jackets, 6mm, .750-inch length, box of 500
          J-6M-825  Jackets, 6mm, .825-inch length, box of 500

     -----------------------------------------------------------------------

                                 DELUXE 243 KIT

          You  can  put together a nice kit that would also be  my  personal 
     choice  for making .243 bullets in the reloading press by ordering  the 
     following items:

          BSD-243R  Core Seater and Point Former, 2-die set
          RFJM-6MR  Rimfire Jacket Maker, .22 LR to 6mm
          LW-25     Lead wire, 25 lb. spool.  (specify 6mm) 
          PCS-1     Corbin Precision Core Cutter
          CM-4      Corbin 4-cavity adjustable core mould (specify 6mm)
          CSL-2     Corbin Swage Lube, 2-ounce bottle
          PE-1      Corbin Power Ejector Unit
          HCT-1     Corbin Hand Cannelure Tool
          J-6M-750  Jackets, 6mm, .750-inch length, box of 500
          J-6M-825  Jackets, 6mm, .825-inch length, box of 500
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------

                                  .25 RIFLE KIT

          We've not advertised the .257 rifle dies for reloading press for a 
     number of deep, dark reasons:  primarily, we didn't want to get too far 
     behind.  But now, with our new die-works going full-blast, it's time to 
     let you know that we have .257 caliber dies developed for the reloading 
     press in a flat base,  6-caliber spitzer design similar to our .224 and-----------------------------------------------------------------

                                  .25 RIFLE KIT

          We've not advertised the .257 rifle dies for reloading press for a 
     number of deep, dark reasons:  primarily, we didn't want to get too far 
     behind.  But now, with our new die-works going full-blast, it's time to 
     let you know that we have .257 caliber dies developed for the reloading 
     press in a flat base,  6-caliber spitzer design similar to our .224 andkets in stock.
          Here  is a potential group of kits you could put together  to  use 
     either  6mm jackets or drawn 7mm jackets (or,  when available,  regular 
     .257 jackets):
          
          BSD-257R  Core Seater and Point Former, 2-die set
          CSL-2     Corbin Swage Lube
          CM-4      Corbin 4-cavity adjustable core mould (specify 257 cal.)
          J-6M-825  Jackets, 6mm caliber, .825-inch length, box of 500
          
          Or,  you could go the deluxe route,  and add the convenience of  a 
     power  ejector and the ability to install precision cannelure  grooves, 
     the  speed of cutting lead wire,  and the ability to use 7mm jackets by 
     adding these items to the above list:

          PE-1      Corbin Power Ejector Unit
          HCT-1     Corbin Hand Cannelure Tool
          LW-25     Lead Wire, 25-lb spool.  (Specify .257 caliber)
          PCS-1     Corbin Precision Core Cutter
          JRD-1-R   Corbin Jacket Reducing Die (Specify 7mm to .257 cal.)
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------

                    HANDGUN CALIBER KITS for RELOADING PRESS

          In the handgun calibers, we offer these calibers:
          
               .25 ACP   .30 Mauser/Luger    .32 ACP        .32 S&W Long
               .32 H&R   .30 Carbine         .380 ACP       .32 Colt    
               .38 S&W   .38 Long Colt       .357 Maximum   9mm Browning
                         .38 Special         .357 Magnum    .32-20 WCF
                              
          For  those of you who know the score,  many of the above  calibers 
     are actually the same diameter,  such as .380 ACP and 9mm,  .38 Special 
     and .357 Magnum.  Thus, you can make several calibers with the same set 
     of  dies,  if  you know what diameter each caliber is supposed  to  be.  
     This  is  covered in great detail in the  Corbin  Technical  Bulletins, 
     Volume  II.   Rather  than repeat each and every one of these  calibers 
     along  with the items that would make kits,  I'll just list  a  generic 
     catalog number and you can pick the numbers to fill in from this list: 

          Available  diameters  in  Corbin  Handgun  Reloading  Press  Swage 
     Dies...

          .251      .308      .312      .314      .355      .357     .358
     
          To  order  a specific caliber of die,  specify either  the  actual 
     caliber  or  the diameter of the bullet from the above  list.   If  you 
     specify   the   caliber  of  the  cartridge,   we  will  use   standard 
     specifications to determine what diameter to ship.   Unless you specify 
     the actual diameter from the above list, it isn't possible to guarentee 
     that what you really wanted is the same as the standard  specifications 
     for the caliber you ordered.   If your 9mm happens to have a .357 bore, 
     then  order  a .357 diameter rather than a 9mm.   Die makers go by  the 
     actual diameter, not by the cartridge designation.
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------

                               ECONOMY HANDGUN KIT

          The  basic handgun package can have just the core seating die  and 
     the  Keith  nose punch provided with it,  to make  semi-wadcutter  type 
     bullets.  To add greater versatility, purchase the point forming die to 
     go with the set.  Here is the basic wadcutter or semi-wadcutter package 
     that I would suggest.   It makes lead,  gas-checked,  half-jacketed, or 
     3/4-jacketed  bullets  (not  with the jacket curved around  the  ogive, 
     however.  That is the job of the point forming die). 

          CS-1-R    Core Seating Die, with Keith punch. (Specify caliber)
          CSL-2     Corbin Swage Lube, 2-ounce bottle 
          CM-4      Corbin 4-cavity adjustable core mould. (Specify caliber)
          
          Now,  in  the  department of bullet  jackets,  there  are  certain 
     options  open  for  .25 caliber that don't apply  elsewhere.   You  can 
     purchase  a  .25  ACP jacket-making kit  (SPJM-25R)  that  turns  fired 
     shotgun primers into 45-50 grain jacketed bullet cups.  In  all the .30 
     calibers,  from .308 to .314,  you can use one size of jacket.   In the 
     .380,  9mm, and all .38/.357 Magnum calibers, you can also use one size 
     of jacket (diameter).  There are several lengths available in .38.
          The right length of jacket for a semi-wadcutter of standard weight 
     is  the .437-inch length in .38,  and for stacking multi-projectiles or 
     half-jacket bullets,  the .250-inch jacket is ideal.  The 0.5-inch long 
     jacket  is  a bit heavy for most single-die sets,  but if you  add  the 
     second die (point former) it is the best all-around choice for all  but 
     the very heaviest weights.   For 200 grain and up,  the 0.7-inch jacket 
     is what you need.
          To  complete your kit,  select one of these jackets for the single 
     die set, or the jacket-making kit for the .25 ACP:

          SPJM-25R  Shotgun primer jacket-maker kit
          J-30-375  Jacket, 30 caliber, 3/8-inch length, box of 500
          J-38-250  Jacket, 38 caliber, 1/4-inch length, box of 500
          J-38-437  Jacket, 38 caliber, .437-inch length, box of 500
          J-38-500  Jacket, 38 caliber, .500-inch length, box of 500
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------

              DELUXE SEMI-WADCUTTER SWAGE KIT FOR HANDGUN CALIBERS
     
          I  don't  see how a person could consider his  swaging  outfit  as 
     being deluxe unless he has the point forming die.   With this die,  you 
     multiply all the previous styles and shapes to incredible levels.   You 
     add  the  ability  to  curve  the jacket  around  the  ogive,  to  make 
     boattailed  and full-jacket bullets,  and to curve the ogive around  so 
     that  a  hollow cavity becomes a pear-shaped or even  a  closed  cavity 
     within the tip of the bullet.  
          When you order the PF-1-R point former separately, be sure to send 
     a  sample  lead  slug and a few seated cores from  your  existing  core 
     seater die (CS-1-R).   The die has to be carefully matched in diameter, 
     and this is one way we can do it.  Another is to get your die back, but 
     you may not want to part with it while we work on the new die.
          When  you order these items,  substitute the diameters listed  for 
     the "XXX" in the die set catalog number.

          BSD-XXXR  Core Seater and Point Former, 2-die set
          CM-4      Corbin 4-Cavity adjustable core mould. (specify caliber)
          CSL-2     Corbin Swage Lube, 2-ounce bottle
          PE-1      Corbin Power Ejector Unit
          HCT-1     Corbin Hand Cannelure Tool
