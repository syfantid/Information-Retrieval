Again, as these doses are immediate or one hour doses, these are strictly
worse case possible results.  The same dosage acquired over a longer time span
would have significantly less drastic effects. (see below for time table)

The body can handle and repair a certian amount of free radical damage whether
it is caused by radiation, drinking alcholol, heavy labor, heavy exercise,
eating slightly rancid food, or from wounds. The following table shows this 
ability of the body to repair itself to a limited extent.

Medical care needed by   Accumulated Radiation Exposures (R) over a period of
                         One week           One month            Four months
None, no deaths          150 R              200 R                300 R
Some, 5% may die         250 R              350 R                500 R
Most, 50% may die        450 R              600 R

  The above chart is from Richard C. Oster Sr.'s article in Journal of Civil
Defense Oct 1987, Fallout Radiation: Levels and Effects.

(Note that the same exposure over 4 months causes 5% deaths whereas the same
exposure over 1 hour causes 50+% deaths)

  A further note.  It has been stated that a daily radiation exposure of 3-12
rads per day will cause no short term effects.  This is true to a limited
extent.  However, in radiation therapy where the typical daily dose is 15 Rads
whole body, is has been noted that serious blood changes occur when day after
day exposures hit around 150-200 R cumlative.  Even if exposure is halted at
that point, blood components will continue to deteriorate for the next 25-35
days.

  The reason for the variance of outcome in exposure RATES is that radiation
of the type that we are talking of is ionizing radiation.  Ionizing radiation
causes the formation of free radicals in the body.  Radiation sickness is a
free radical disease just as a hang-over is.  The body can handle a certian
amount of free radicals before the free radicals overwhelm the body's free
radical scavenging system.  When overwhelmed, part of the free radical damage
consists of damage to the body's free radical scavenging system creating
a vicious cycle.  The body's ability to scavenge free radicals may be improved
by a factor of three using various vitamins and minerals (see the three books,
LIFE EXTENSION - A PARTICAL SCIENTIFIC APPROACH, THE LIFE EXTENSION COMPANION,
THE LIFE EXTENSION WEIGHT LOSS PROGRAM by Durk Pearson & Sandy Shaw).

   The reason for the vairiance of outcome from exposure DOSES is that there
is a wide variance in people's ability to handle free radicals.  This is based
on genetics, age, state of physical conditioning, overall health, and quality
of nutrition.
