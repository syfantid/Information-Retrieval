                    WHO CONTROLS THE MEDIA


   What do Arnaud de Borchgrave, editor-in-cheif of the
"conservative" Washington Times, and Max Frankel, top dog at the
"liberal" New York Times, have in common?
   At least one thing, at any rate; Both are members of the
Rockefeller family's private and secretive international
pressure group known as the Council on Foreigh Relations (CFR).
   De Borchgrave and Frankel join a long list of powerful media
personalities, who are members of the CFR and/or of the
Trilaterial Commission (TC), another Rockefeller family front
group that plays a major role in shaping U.S. foriegn policy.
   Rockefeller influence on the media is immense, particularly
on the major television networks. In fact, according to
researcher Peter Borsnan, the Rockefeller family's Chase
Manhatan Bank ( and the other Rockefeller institutions)are among
the largest holders of network stock, with substancial interests
in all three networks.
   Chase Manhattan controls fully 14 percent of CBS stock. Stock
analysts note that with stock widely distributed among
shareholders, institutions can weild influence or outright
control with 5 percent, sometimes as little as 1 or 2 percent,
equity.
   The accompanying chart shows some of the major media figures
(aapast and present)--editors, reporters, corporate directors,
and others--who belong or have belonged to the CFR and the TC.
